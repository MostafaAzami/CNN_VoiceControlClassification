# Voice-Controlled Wheelchair for Persian-Speaking Users

This repository contains the code implementation for the research paper:

**Designing a Voice-controlled Wheelchair for Persian-speaking Users Using Deep Learning Networks with a Small Dataset**

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project aims to develop a smart wheelchair controlled by Persian voice commands using deep learning. The system utilizes **spectrogram-based classification** with **Inception-V3** for recognizing five essential commands:
- **Stop**
- **Left**
- **Right**
- **Forward**
- **Backward**




## ðŸ“Š Results
- **Dataset Size**: 1050 augmented spectrogram images (50 speakers)
- **Best Model**: Inception-V3 with fine-tuning
- **Accuracy**: **83.33%** on test set
